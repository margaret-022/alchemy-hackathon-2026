# Twitter Thread: Transaction Pressure

**Tweet 1 (Hook)**

One of our designers made a game during our internal hackathon.

It uses real blockchain data.

There's no token. No wallet. No financial mechanics at all.

Here's what she built 🧵

**Tweet 2 (The Game)**

Transaction Pressure is a minesweeper-style puzzle game about API rate limits.

You approve tiles. Pressure builds. Push too hard or repeat too much, and the system breaks.

Win by reaching 25 approvals before triggering an incident.

---

**Tweet 3 (The Blockchain Part)**

Every tile on the grid can map to a real Sepolia transaction.

The game fetches the latest block, pulls transaction data, and turns it into gameplay.

Real tx hashes. Real method selectors. Real addresses.

But here's the thing—

**Tweet 4 (The Design Choice)**

The blockchain data is flavor, not causality.

Pressure meters, incidents, clues—all synthetic. The game runs offline. If the RPC fails, you still play.

We wanted to show that blockchain infrastructure can be creative material, not just financial rails.

---

**Tweet 5 (What It Teaches)**

The two pressure axes map to real reliability concepts:

→ Volume: too many requests too fast
→ Hotspot: too many similar requests

The winning strategy? Alternate. Slow down. Manage patterns.

This is how production systems actually fail.

**Tweet 6 (The Point)**

Most "crypto games" are about tokens and trading.

This one is about rate limits and minesweeper logic.

No economic loop. No speculation. Just blockchain data turned into something playable.

---

**Tweet 7 (The Culture)**

Built solo during a 3-day hackathon window.

No production expectations. Just: what can you ship?

This is what happens when you give designers access to infrastructure and room to experiment.

---

**Tweet 8 (CTA)**

Try it yourself:

→ No build step. Open index.html in a browser.
→ Optional: add your Alchemy key to see live Sepolia transactions on the grid.

**Tweet 9 (Closer)**

Blockchain infrastructure is just infrastructure.

It can power DeFi. It can also power a puzzle game about rate limits.

What you build with it is up to you.

## Alt Version: Shorter Thread (5 tweets)

If you want a tighter version:

**1.** One of our designers made a puzzle game during our hackathon. It uses real blockchain data. No token. No wallet. 🧵

**2.** Transaction Pressure: a minesweeper-style game about API rate limits. Approve tiles. Manage pressure. Don't break the system.

**3.** Every tile can map to a real Sepolia transaction. But the blockchain data is flavor—the game works offline too.

**4.** No economic loop. No speculation. Just infrastructure turned into gameplay.

**5.** Try it: [LINK]. Built in 3 days. Runs in any browser.
